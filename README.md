Controlling a DC motor with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) using the PIC16F877A microcontroller involves generating a PWM signal and interfacing it with a motor driver circuit. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

* Set up the PIC16F877A microcontroller: Configure the necessary I/O pins for PWM generation and motor control. In this case, you'll need to select appropriate pins for PWM output and connect them to the motor driver circuit.

* Configure the PWM module: Set the PWM module of the microcontroller to generate the desired frequency and duty cycle for controlling the motor speed. This involves configuring the PWM timebase, duty cycle resolution, and other relevant parameters.

* Initialize the motor driver circuit: Connect the motor driver circuit to the microcontroller. The motor driver circuit typically consists of power transistors or H-bridge circuits that control the direction and speed of the DC motor. Initialize the necessary I/O pins and control signals to interface with the motor driver.

* Generate the PWM signal: Utilize the microcontroller's PWM module to generate a PWM signal with the desired duty cycle. The duty cycle determines the average voltage supplied to the motor, thus controlling its speed. Adjusting the duty cycle will change the motor speed accordingly.

* Control the motor direction: Depending on the motor driver circuit used, you may need to set specific control signals to control the motor's direction (forward or reverse). This typically involves setting appropriate logic levels on specific control pins of the motor driver circuit.

* Implement the control logic: Write the control logic in the microcontroller firmware to generate the desired motor speed and direction. This may involve reading input values from sensors or user interfaces and adjusting the PWM duty cycle and control signals accordingly.

* Test and iterate: Upload the firmware to the microcontroller and test the motor control. If necessary, fine-tune the control parameters or adjust the PWM frequency to achieve the desired motor behavior.
